# Interactive-Light-Printing

The project attempts to narrow the gap between design, thinking and making by creating a platform for real-time interaction with robot. 
The project aims to create a platform for human-robot collaboration in creating art. The artifact is a drawing that uses a light source as the tool and long-exposure photography and videography to capture the robot movement to produce the final photo. 
The setup contains an ABB IRB 120 robotic arm, a camera, a laptop as the processing unit, and a human. The camera is used for recognizing the pose and gesture of the human interacting with the robot. Based on that data, the robot changes its toolpath in real-time. Together they create an interactive non-predictive piece of art that stems from the same toolpath but is unique to each user and every time it is created.
